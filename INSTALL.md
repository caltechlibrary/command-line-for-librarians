# Presentation installation notes

This presentation was authored using Markdown. The website is produce with standard Unix commands and three open source utilities I wrote--

+ [md2slides](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/md2slides) converts a single markdown file into a series of HTML pages that serve as slides.
+ [mkpage](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/mkpage) converts the markdown applying templating for the website
+ [ws](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/ws) a simple localhost webserver

If this these are all available you should be able to run the *Makefile* and build your own copy of the website.
