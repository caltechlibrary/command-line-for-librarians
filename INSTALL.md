# Presentation installation notes

This presentation was authored using Markdown. The website is produce with standard Unix commands and three open source utilities I wrote--

+ [md2slides](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/md2slides) converts a single markdown file into a series of HTML pages that serve as slides.
+ [mkpage](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/mkpage) converts the markdown applying templating for the website
+ [findfile](https://github.com/rsdoiel/findfile) locates the files needed to build site and presentation

This these are all available you should be able to run the *Makefile* and
build your own copy of the website.
