# Command Line for Librarians

  MMWConf presentation Fall 2016

## Abstract

The migration from print to more online resources has led to exponentially greater amounts of data that librarians must organize and curate. Learning to manage larger volumes of information by leveraging the command line would benefit librarians and other knowledge professionals. This presentation will introduce some essential command line skills, such as BASH basics and curl, and ways to use those skills for common library functions. The presenters will also demonstrate some library-specific tools that utilize the command line, such the OCLC Classify API and Open Refine. The presentation seeks to help knowledge professionals better work with the data they use every day.
